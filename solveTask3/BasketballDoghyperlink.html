    <a href=" https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/"><img src= "images\basketBallDog.jpg" alt="Basketball Dog" width="300" height="200"></a>
    <p>4 out of 5 stars</p>
    <p>
        From director <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learnin
        the true value of friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.
        <br>
        This movie has everything you could ask for:
        <ul>
            <li>Basketball</li>
            <li>A dog</li>
            <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and
     the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.
