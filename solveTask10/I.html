    <h3>Overflow: visible</h3>
    <div style="height: 100px; background-color: lightcoral; width: 500px; overflow: visible; background-color: orangered;"> Coding can often feel overwhelming, especially when you're trying to learn new concepts or troubleshoot persistent issues. The complexity of managing multiple files, understanding different languages, and integrating various tools can easily make you feel like you're drowning in a sea of information. Sometimes, you might feel stuck or frustrated when your code doesn't work as expected, despite putting in a lot of effort. This can lead to feelings of doubt and confusion, making it hard to keep pushing forward. But it's important to remember that this overwhelming feeling is a natural part of the learning process. Every programmer, no matter how experienced, faces challenges and obstacles. Taking things one step at a time, asking for help when needed, and celebrating small wins can help you manage the stress and build confidence along the way.</div>
